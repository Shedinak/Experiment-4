# Create a Datacenter with One Host and Run One Cloudlet (CloudSim)

This repository demonstrates a **basic CloudSim simulation** where a single datacenter with one host is created, and one cloudlet is executed on it. The project is intended for **cloud computing laboratory experiments** and beginner-level understanding of CloudSim architecture.

---

## Aim

To create a simple cloud computing environment using CloudSim by configuring one datacenter with a single host and executing one cloudlet, and to observe the simulation results.



## Objectives

* Understand the working of the CloudSim toolkit
* Learn how to create a datacenter and host in CloudSim
* Execute a single cloudlet on a virtual machine
* Analyze cloudlet execution output

---

##  Software Requirements

* Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS
* Java Development Kit (JDK): 8 or above
* IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans
* CloudSim Toolkit: Version 3.x

---

##  Hardware Requirements

* Processor: Intel i3 or higher
* RAM: Minimum 4 GB
* Storage: At least 10 GB free disk space

##  Simulation Workflow

1. Initialize CloudSim
2. Create a Datacenter with one Host
3. Create a Broker
4. Create one Virtual Machine (VM)
5. Create one Cloudlet
6. Bind the Cloudlet to the VM
7. Start Simulation
8. Display Results
